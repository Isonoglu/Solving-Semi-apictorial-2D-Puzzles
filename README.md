# Seminar Project (ETF Sarajevo)

This repository contains code for a seminar project by two students in a masterâ€™s course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo.

## Whatâ€™s here
- The entire project currently lives in **a single file**.
- Variables, functions, and comments are written in **Bosnian**.

## Publication
In the meantime, we published a paper on this topic: "Automated Image Processing Approach for Solving Semi-apictorial 2D Puzzles". You can read it **[here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10694338)**.

## Why it looks like this
Over the past two years, we havenâ€™t found enough time to:
- refactor and **modularize** the code,
- translate it into English, and
- add documentation.

Since time is tight, weâ€™re releasing the code **as-is**, in Bosnian. The good news: modern **LLM models** are advanced enough that the code and comments should still be understandable in other languages. ðŸ™‚

Thanks for your understanding and interest!
